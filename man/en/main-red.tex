\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Program}

{\sc RESPACK} is a first-principles calculation software for evaluating the interaction parameters of materials, and is able to calculate the maximally localized Wannier functions, the RPA response functions, and frequency-dependent electronic interaction parameters. {\sc RESPACK} consists of three programs:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Wannier function calculation (\verb+wannier+),
\item dielectric function calculation (\verb+chiqw+),
\item electronic interaction calculation (direct integral: \verb+calc_w3d+, exchange integral: \verb+calcj3d+).
\end{enumerate}
These three programs are independent and each program needs
\begin{itemize}
\item input file (namelist form)
\item files as band-calculation output
\end{itemize}
{\sc RESPACK} receives input data from a band calculation using norm-conserving pseudopotentials with plane-wave basis sets. Automatic generation scripts which convert results of the band calculation to inputs for RESPACK are prepared for {\sc xTAPP} and {\sc Quantum ESPRESSO} codes. RESPACK can be successfully applied to wide materials such as metals, semiconductors, transition-metal compounds, and organic compounds. It supports {\sc OpenMP/MPI} and can be used in both laboratory-computer environment and System B at Institute for Solid State Physics, the University of Tokyo.

In this manual, we describe procedures to evaluate effective interaction parameters of Al as a benchmark. We also describe procedures of the case of La$_2$CuO$_4$ for constrained RPA calculation. Examples of Si, TiO$_2$, SrVO$_3$, organic compound (TMTSF)$_2$PF$_6$ are also presented.

\subsection{Unit system}

Programs are described in atomic units, but for input and output, \AA, \verb+Ry+, \verb+eV+, and lattice coordinates are used.

\subsection{Download source code}
The source code cab be downloaded from the official website https://sites.google.com/view/kazuma7k6r. Please download \verb+RESPACK.tar.gz+.

\subsection{\label{compile}Compiling source code}

Firstly, you unpack the source code \verb+RESPACK.tar.gz+ in your machine. In a directory \verb+RESPACK+, you see five directories (i) \verb+sample+ containing the inputs of calculation examples, (ii) \verb+src+ containing source codes, (iii) \verb+util+ containing necessary scripts to supplement calculation, 
\tr{(iv) {\tt config} containing setting files of {\tt CMake}}, and (iv) {\tt GPL} containing the software license. 

\subsubsection{\tr{Compile using CMake}}
\tr{RESPACK can be compiled using {\tt CMake}. In {\tt CMake}, user generates a working directory for compilation, and then creates a {\tt Makefile} script using the {\tt cmake} command. Then, the program is compiled using the {\tt make} command. The following is the work flow.}
\vspace{3mm}\hrule
\begin{verbatim}
tar -zxvf RESPACK.tar.gz
cd RESPACK
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCONFIG=gcc -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=PATH_TO_INSTALL ../
make
make install
\end{verbatim}
\hrule\vspace{3mm}
\tr{If {\tt make} is successful, executable files are created in each directory under {\tt RESPACK/build/src.} By executing {\tt make install}, the executable files will be installed in the {\tt bin} directory under the directory specified with the {\tt -DCMAKE\_INSTALL\_PREFIX} option. If the {\tt -DCMAKE\_INSTALL\_PREFIX} option is omitted, it will be installed under {\tt /usr/local}. Also, the {\tt -DCONFIG} option are used for reading {\tt CMake} configuration files stored in the {\tt config} directory. The following options are available}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \tr{
    sekirei: System B (``sekirei") in Institute Solid State Physics, The University of Tokyo}
    \item \tr{
    intel: Intel compiler }
    \item \tr{
    gcc: GNU compiler}
\end{itemize}
\tr{If you want to change the source-code compile or re-execute the {\tt cmake} command, it is recommended that you delete the working directory itself ({\tt build}) and restart, because the previous settings may remain.}

\tr{Another point to note is that {\tt Cmake} in an environment that uses the {\sc intel MPI} library. In this case it is better to specify the compiler directly; specify {\tt mpiifort} of {\sc intel MPI} compiler with the {\tt -DMPI\_Fortran\_COMPILER} option below.}

\tr{\texttt{cmake -DMPI\_Fortran\_COMPILER=mpiifort -DCMAKE\_INSTALL\_PREFIX=PATH\_TO\_INSTALL ../}} 

\subsubsection{\tr{Compile using Makefile}}
\tr{Instead of using {\tt CMake},user can compile using {\tt Makefile} which is prepared for each program.} When moving to {\tt src}, user finds three source directories; {\tt calc\_int}, {\tt chiqw}, {\tt wannier}.  {\tt Makefile} for source compilation are prepared in each source directory. User moves to the source directory and executes {\tt make}. In the case of \verb+chiqw+, the work so far is as follows: 
\vspace{3mm}\hrule\vspace{3mm}
\tr{{\tt tar -zxvf RESPACK.tar.gz}} 

\tr{{\tt cd RESPACK/src/chiqw/}}  

\tr{{\tt make}} 
\vspace{3mm}\hrule\vspace{3mm}
After \verb+make+, an executable file \verb+calc_chiqw+ is generated. This procedure is the same for other programs.

\subsection{Calculation directory}
In this tutorial, the directory in which the calculation is performed is set to the current directory {\tt ./} and described as \tr{{\tt calculation\_directory}.} User moves the executable files generated via {\tt make} in the current directory. After the RESPACK calculations, the calculation results are accommodated in {\tt ./dir-xxx}. This is the preparation stage for calculation.

\clearpage 

\section{\label{gendirwfn}Making input files of RESPACK} 

In RESPACK, band calculations must be executed in advance. In this section, we describe the procedure to connect the band calculation software {\sc xTAPP} and {\sc Quantum ESPRESSO} to RESPACK. Details of the band calculation are given in the official manual of each software. Here, we focus on the procedures necessary for {\sc RESPACK} calculation.

\subsection{\label{xtapp2respack}From xTAPP to RESPACK}

\tr{After {\sc xTAPP} band calculation, we generate input files of RESPACK calculation with a script. First, we move to directory {\tt RESPACK/util/xtapp2respack} and compile source codes. Executable files {\tt wfn2respack} and {\tt strconv} are generated. These {\tt wfn2respack}, {\tt strconv}, and a script file {\tt xtapp2respack.sh} are necessary for convert. Then, we move back to the directory where band calculation was executed and copy these above three files to the calculation directory. With these files, input files for RESPACK are generated from a wave function file ({\tt @@@.wfn}) and a structure file ({\tt @@@.str}) (where {\tt @@@} specifies the material name in {\sc xTAPP}). After executing the script, the directory {\tt ./dir-wfn} is created and 9 files named {\tt dat.xxx} are generated in this directory. For example, in the case of Al calculation, the work so far is as follows:} 
\vspace{3mm}\hrule\vspace{3mm}
\tr{\texttt{cd RESPACK/util/xtapp2respack/}}

\tr{\texttt{make}} 

\tr{\texttt{cp wfn2respack calculation\_directory/.}}

\tr{\texttt{cp strconv calculation\_directory/.}}

\tr{\texttt{cp xtapp2respack.sh calculation\_directory/.}} 

\tr{\texttt{cd calculation\_directory/.}}

\tr{\texttt{./xtapp2respack.sh -b ./wfn2respack -s ./strconv Al}}
\vspace{3mm}\hrule\vspace{3mm}
Each file to be generated is as follows. For the format of each file, see the \ref{fileformat} chapter.
\vspace{3mm}\hrule
\begin{enumerate}
\item \verb+./dir-wfn/dat.bandcalc+ (band calculation information)
\item \verb+./dir-wfn/dat.sample-k+ (sample k points)
\item \verb+./dir-wfn/dat.nkm+ (the number of expanded G vector)
\item \verb+./dir-wfn/dat.eigenvalue+ (energy eigenvalue)
\item \verb+./dir-wfn/dat.kg+ (reciprocal lattice G vector)
\item \verb+./dir-wfn/dat.wfn+ (wave function)
\item \verb+./dir-wfn/dat.lattice+ (lattice vector)
\item \verb+./dir-wfn/dat.symmetry+ (Symmetry information)
\item \tr{{\tt ./dir-wfn/dat.atom\_position} (Atomic position)}
\end{enumerate}
\hrule\vspace{3mm}
The above treatment is the connection procedure from {\sc xTAPP} band calculation to RESPACK.

\subsection{From {\sc Quantum ESPRESSO} to RESPACK}

After {\sc Quantum ESPRESSO} band calculation, we generate input files of the RESPACK calculation as follows. 
\tr{This procedure uses Python script {\tt qe2respack.py} in the directory {\tt RESPACK/util/qe2respack}. We first move the calculation directory, and execute the script as follows:}
\begin{verbatim}
python qe2respack.py outdir/prefix.save/
\end{verbatim}
Here, \verb+./outdir/prefix.save/+ is the directory containing the output of {\sc Quantum ESPRESSO} band calculation. After this procedure, the directory {\tt ./dir-wfn} is created under the calculation directory where the python script was run. 9 files named \verb+dat.xxx+ (see \ref{xtapp2respack}) are generated. \tr{If {\tt ./dir-wfn} already exists, it will be copied to {\tt ./dir-wfn.backup/}. At that time, if {\tt ./dir-wfn.backup/} exists, it will be deleted.} 

\tr{Also note that the step of performing {\tt qe2respack.py} is always performed immediately after "SCF calculation" which is performed with a variable {\tt calculation='scf'} in namelist {\tt \&control} of {\sc Quantum ESPRESSO}. This is because RESPACK needs the data for the irreducible $k$ points. The above treatment is the connection procedure from {\sc Quantum ESPRESSO} band calculation to RESPACK.} 

\clearpage 

\section{\label{wannier}wannier}

Here, we describe the procedure of Wannier function calculation (\verb+wannier+). The calculation conditions are 6$\times$6$\times$6 $k$-point sampling (the total number of the irreducible $k$ points is 16) and 36-Ry wave function cutoff. The total number of bands to be calculated is 50 (occupied band number 1, Partial occupied band number 1, unoccupied band number 48, including a band up to about 120 eV above the Fermi level).
\vspace{-3mm}
\subsection{\label{input-wannier}Input file}
Here, we explain the input file \verb+input.in+ for the Wannier function calculation of Al. The input file uses the FORTRAN namelist format. The input of the Wannier function calculation consists of three namelists \verb+&param_wannier+ (condition of the Wannier function calculation), \verb+&param_interpolation+ (condition of the Wannier-interpolation band calculation), and \verb+&param_visualization+ (condition of visualization of the realspace Wannier functions).
\vspace{-3mm}
\subsubsection{\&param\_wannier} 
The namelist \verb+&param_wannier+ contains parameters for the Wannier function  calculation. Parameters can be arranged freely. Parameters in the namelist are set to default values if not defined. The explanation of each parameter is written in the right of \verb+!+. A mark ``\verb+n+" in the explanation part indicates that the parameter is a required variable, and an error occurs if you forget to input. A parameter written as ``\verb+o+" represents an optional parameter, and if you omit the input, the default value is set.

\hrule\vspace{3mm}
\verb+&param_wannier+ requires four necessary parameters: \verb+N_wannier+, \verb+Lower_energy_window+, \\ \verb+Upper_energy_window+, {\tt N\_initial\_guess}. \verb+Lower_energy_window+ and \verb+Upper_energy_window+ are variables that specify the energy window. The program makes \verb+N_wannier+ pieces of the Wannier functions from this energy range. Figure~\ref{EW} shows the relationship between band dispersion and energy window. The lower limit of the energy window was set to $-10$ eV, and the upper limit was set to +35 eV. Nine Wannier functions (\verb+N_wannier = 9+) are made from the bands within this window.

\verb+N_initial_guess+ is a variable specifying the number of initial Gaussian. We prepare nine in this calculation (\verb+N_initial_guess = 9+). The initial Gaussians are also necessary inputs. This corresponds to "\verb+s 0.2d0 0.0d0 0.0d0 0.0d0+" to "\verb+dx2 0.2d0 0.0d0 0.0d0 0.0d0+". We use nine Gaussians of type {\tt s, px, py, pz, dxy, dyz, dz2, dzx, dx2-y2} placed on the Al site as initial guess, where {\tt x, y, z} is the Cartesian coordinates used to represent the Bravais lattice.

\caption{Band structure of Al. The lower limit of the energy window is $-10$ eV ({\tt Lower\_energy\_window=-10.0}) and the upper limit is +35 eV ({\tt Upper\_energy\_window=35.0}). From the bands in this window, nine Wannier functions ({\tt N\_wannier=9}) were created from nine initial Gaussian ({\tt N\_initial\_guess=9}).}
\label{EW}
\end{figure}

\verb+icell+ is a variable that specifies crystal lattice. \verb+icell=0+ is default which means an automatic search. \verb+EPS_SPILLAGE+, \verb+EPS_SPREAD+, \verb+DAMP+, \verb+MAX_STEP_LENGTH+ are parameters for convergence of the calculation. These are set to the default values.

\verb+set_inner_window+ is a parameter that specifies the inner energy window. \verb+Lower_inner_window+ and \verb+Upper_inner_window+ are variables that specify the inner energy window. When these parameters are specified, the Wannier functions are constructed so that the bands within the inner energy window coincides with the original bands. In this Al calculation, \verb+set_inner_window=F+, so the inner window is not set. Details of these parameters are described in La$_2$CuO$_4$ calculation (chapter \ref{La2CuO4}).

\verb+flg_initial_guess_direc+ is a variable specifying the coordinate system for displaying the Gaussian function. If you want to change to local coordinates instead of the Cartesian coordinates, you set \verb+flg_initial_guess_direc=1+. This flag is explained in TiO$_2$ calculation in the \ref{TiO2} chapter.

\verb+flg_BMAT+ is a variable related to the procedure for making the initial guess of the Wannier function. If \verb+flg_BMAT=1+, we linearly combine the Gaussians to make initial guess as follows:
\begin{eqnarray}
w_{j}^{in}({\bf r})=\sum_{i}B_{ij} g_i({\bf r}). \nonumber
\end{eqnarray} 
If \verb+flg_BMAT=0+, the linear combination is not performed, and hence the B matrix is an identity matrix. If \verb+flg_BMAT=1+ is set, the coefficient $B_{ij}$ of the linear combination is read following the information of the initial Gaussian. This will be explained in Si calculation in the \ref{Si} chapter. 

\tr{The variable {\tt electron\_number\_wannier\_space} specifies the number of electrons in the Wannier space. If this variable is set, the Fermi level is recalculated. The Fermi level is estimated so that the number of electrons ({\tt 3.0} in the present example) matches the numerical integral for the density of states until the Fermi level. The default is {\tt 0.0} and in this case the Fermi level obtained in the band calculation is employed.} 

\tr{Set {\tt flg\_global\_dos=1} if you want to calculate the density of states for the band energy obtained in the band calculation. The default is {\tt 0} and it is not calculated. The density of states in the Wannier space is always calculated.}

\tr{Set {\tt flg\_fermisurface=1} if you want to calculate the Fermi surface. The input of the Fermi-surface drawing software {\sc Fermisurfer} is output. The default is {\tt 0} and it is not calculated.} 
\vspace{-3mm}
\subsubsection{\&param\_interpolation}  
The namelist \verb+&param_interpolation+ contains input variables for drawing the Wannier-interpolation band. The interpolation-band calculation is always performed, so variables in this namelist are almost required parameters. An error occurs if you forget to specify the required parameters. Variable explanations are indicated in the right of \verb+!+. 
\vspace{5mm}\hrule
\begin{verbatim}
&param_interpolation   
N_sym_points=5,   !n: Total number of symmetric k points in calculation lines
Ndiv=40/          !o: Number of divisions between symmetric k points
0.500 0.500 0.500 !n: Symmetric k point; SK_sym_pts(1:3,1); L
0.000 0.000 0.000 !n: Symmetric k point; SK_sym_pts(1:3,2); G
0.500 0.000 0.500 !n: Symmetric k point; SK_sym_pts(1:3,3); X
0.500 0.250 0.750 !n: Symmetric k point; SK_sym_pts(1:3,4); W
0.500 0.500 0.500 !n: Symmetric k point; SK_sym_pts(1:3,5); L 
\end{verbatim}
\hrule\vspace{3mm}
In this namelist, you specify the number of symmetric $k$ points in the Brillouin zone, \verb+N_sym_points+. \verb+Ndiv+ is the number of divisions between two symmetric $k$ points and is an optional parameter. The default value is \verb+40+. Below this namelist, give the coordinates of the symmetric $k$ point (in reciprocal lattice coordinates). It is desirable to compare the original bands obtained by the band calculation with the Wannier-interpolation bands, and to check whether the latter is well reproduced the former.

\subsubsection{\&param\_visualization} 

The namelist \verb+&param_visualization+ contains input variables for drawing the realspace Wannier function. When calculation was completed, the realspace Wannier function data for drawing in visualization software {\sc VESTA} (http://jp-minerals.org/vesta/jp/) is generated.
\vspace{5mm}\hrule
\begin{verbatim}
&param_visualization   
flg_vis_wannier=1,!o: Calculate realspace Wannier function (do not: 0, do 1)
N_write_wannier=9,!o: Total number of realspace Wannier functions to be calculated
ix_vis_min=-1,    !o: Draw range of Wannier function (starting lattice in a1 direction)
ix_vis_max= 1,    !o: Draw range of Wannier function (end lattice in a1 direction)
iy_vis_min=-1,    !o: Draw range of Wannier function (starting lattice in a2 direction)
iy_vis_max= 1,    !o: Draw range of Wannier function (end lattice in a2 direction)
iz_vis_min=-1,    !o: Draw range of Wannier function (starting lattice in a3 direction)
iz_vis_max= 1,    !o: Draw range of Wannier function (end lattice in a3 direction)
\end{verbatim}
\hrule\vspace{5mm}
If you want to calculate the realspace Wannier function, you set \verb+flg_vis_wannier=1+. The default is \verb+0+, which does not perform calculation. \verb+N_write_wannier+ is the number of the realspace Wannier functions you want to calculate. By default, this variable is set to \verb+N_wannier+. You can specify fewer than \verb+N_wannier+. In this case, the program calculates \verb+N_write_wannier+ species of the Wannier functions (see chapter \ref{select-wannier}).

\subsection{\label{job-wannier}Execute job}
The job is executed as follows. The commands in the sh system are as follows.
\vspace{3mm}\hrule
\begin{verbatim}
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=16
export MKL_NUM_THREADS=16
./calc_wannier < input.in > LOG.wannier  
\end{verbatim}
\hrule\vspace{3mm}
\verb+calc_wannier+ is an executable file for calculating the Wannier function. Jobs are executed with \verb+input.in+ placed in the current directory and band-calculation files placed in \verb+./dir-wfn+. This job is \verb+openmp+ job (using 16 threads). The standard output of the calculation is output to \verb+LOG.wannier+.
\vspace{-3mm}
\subsection{\label{result-wannier}Calculation results}
When the job is executed, the directory \verb+dir-wan+ is created under the calculation directory. The calculation result is output in this directory. The output file is as follows.
\vspace{3mm}\hrule
\begin{enumerate}
\item \verb+./dir-wan/dat.h_mat_r+ (Realspace transfer matrix)
\item \verb+./dir-wan/dat.iband+ (Wannier-interpolation band)
\item \verb+./dir-wan/dat.umat+ (Unitary matrix)
\item \verb+./dir-wan/dat.wan+ (Expansion coefficients of Wannier function)
\item \verb+./dir-wan/dat.wan-center+ (Position of center of Wannier function)
\item \verb+./dir-wan/dat.ns-nb+ (Band information considered in Wannier-function calculation)
\item \tr{{\tt ./dir-wan/dat.wan-realspace-001.grd} $\sim$ {\tt dat.wan-realspace-009.grd}} (Realspace Wannier function)
\item \tr{{\tt ./dir-wan/dat.supercell-002x002x002-Al.cif} (Crystal structure)}
\item \verb+./dir-wan/dat.frmsf+ (Fermi surface data)

\item \tr{{\tt ./dir-wan/dat.dos.wan-total} (Density of states in Wannier space)} 
\item \tr{{\tt ./dir-wan/dat.dos.wan-001} $\sim$ {\tt dat.dos.wan-009} (Partial density of states)}  
\end{enumerate}
\hrule \vspace{3mm}

\verb+dat.h_mat_r+ contains data for the realspace transfer matrix: the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian matrix elements with the Wannier function $\langle w_{i{\bf 0}}|h_{KS}|w_{j{\bf R}}\rangle$. The range of the lattice ${\bf R}$ is \verb+-Na1:Na1+ along the $a_1$ direction, \verb+-Na2:Na2+ along the direction of $a_2$, \verb+-Na3:Na3+ along the $a_3$ direction (The values of \verb+Na1+, \verb+Na2+, \verb+Na3+ are automatically set from the sample-$k$ point number).

In this program, the $i$ th Wannier function of the lattice {\bf R} is defined as follows:
\begin{eqnarray}
w_{i{\bf R}}({\bf r})=\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\sum_{{\bf k}}^{N}e^{-i{\bf kR}} \sum_{\alpha=N_s({\bf k})}^{N_b({\bf k})} U_{\alpha i}^{{\bf k}} \psi_{\alpha{\bf k}}({\bf r}), \label{wir}
\end{eqnarray} 
where $N$ is the total number of Monkhorst-Pack $k$ mesh. $N_s({\bf k})$ is the starting point number of the bands used to make the Wannier function, and $N_b({\bf k}) $ is the total number of those bands, which are automatically calculated from the energy-window information. $N_s({\bf k}), N_b({\bf k})$ are stored in \verb+dat.ns-nb+, and the transformation matrix \{$U_{\alpha i}^{{\bf k}}$\} is contained in \verb+dat.umat+. Note that these quantities depend on the $k$ point. $\psi_{\alpha {\bf k}}({\bf r})$ is the Bloch wave function and is defined as follows: 
\begin{eqnarray}
\psi_{\alpha{\bf k}}({\bf r})=\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_{{\bf G}} c_{{\bf k+G},\alpha} \frac{1}{\sqrt{\Omega}} e^{i({\bf k+G})\cdot{\bf r}},  \label{pak} 
\end{eqnarray} 
where $\Omega$ is the volume of the calculation cell. Both the Wannier function $w_{i {\bf R}}({\bf r})$ and the Bloch function $\psi_{\alpha{\bf k}}({\bf r})$ are normalized in the crystal volume. When one inserts Eq.~(\ref{pak}) into the Eq.~(\ref{wir}), the Wannier function at the home cell ({\bf R=0}) is written as
\begin{eqnarray}
w_{i{\bf 0}}({\bf r})
=\frac{1}{N}
\sum_{{\bf k}}^{N}
\sum_{{\bf G}} 
\tilde{c}_{{\bf k+G},i}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{\Omega}}
e^{i({\bf k+G})\cdot{\bf r}} 
\end{eqnarray}
with 
\begin{eqnarray}

\end{verbatim}
\hrule\vspace{5mm}

\verb+Ecut_for_eps+ is the cutoff energy of the polarization function (unit: Ry). By default, it is set to 1/10 of the cutoff energy of the wave function used in the band calculation (in the Al case, since the wave function cutoff is 36 Ry, the polarization function cutoff is set to 3.6 Ry). \verb+Num_freq_grid+ is the total number of calculation frequencies of the polarization function. By default, a log grid of 70 points is generated. \verb+N_CALC_BAND+ is the number of bands considered in the polarization calculation. By default, the number of bands calculated in the band calculation is set. From this number of bands, the maximum excitation energy $E_{max}$ is determined. \tr{The calculated frequency is taken up to $3E_{max}$ by considering the Lorentz tail of the polarization function.}

\verb+MPI_num_proc_per_qcomm+, \verb+MPI_num_qcomm+, \verb+MPI_io_rank+ are parameters for MPI calculation. In the case of the above setting value, 6 MPI calculation is assumed, and the output is in charge of the master MPI. 
\tr{Parallel computation for $q$ points can be performed by setting the variable {\tt MPI\_num\_qcomm}, where ${\bf q}$ specifies the irreducible wavevector for the polarization function. This is discussed in more detail in Chapter~\ref{qcom}.} 

\verb+Green_func_delt+, \verb+ttrhdrn_dmna+, \verb+ttrhdrn_dmnr+ are parameters for tetrahedron calculation. All default values are prepared. \tr{{\tt shift\_ef} is used for artificially shift of the Fermi level (unit is eV).} \verb+Max_excitation_energy+ is set when you want to limit excitation energy (unit is eV).

\verb+flg_cRPA+ is a variable that specifies whether or not constrained RPA calculation is performed. By default, normal RPA calculation is performed, so \verb+flg_cRPA=0+. When performing constrained RPA calculation (\verb+flg_cRPA=1+), there are two strategies. One is to specify the exclusion of the polarization by the Wannier functions, and the other is to specify the exclusion of the polarization by specifying the energy window. The default is the former (if you want to use the latter option please contact me). {\tt In the case of the former, the {\tt wannier} calculation (Chapter~\ref{wannier}) must be executed before the {\tt chiqw} calculation.} The constrained RPA calculation will be described in detail in the subsequent La$_2$CuO$_4$ calculation (Chapter~\ref{La2CuO4}).

An option to specify the calculation $q$ point is also provided (\verb+flg_calc_type=2+). Details are described in Chapter~\ref{bulkjob}.

%Band calculation data for the \verb+chiqw+ calculation must be $k$ point data of Monkhorst-Pack mesh. The band calculation data for the \verb+chiqw+ calculation must be data calculated at the $k$ point of the Monkhorst-Pack mesh. The data \verb+dat.sample-k+, \verb+dat.nkm+, \verb+dat.eigenvalue+, \verb+dat.kg+, \verb+dat.wfn+ obtained for irreducible $k$ points are converted to all $k$-point data on the Monkhorst-Pack mesh by using symmetry information of \verb+dat.symmetry+.

\subsection{\label{job-chiqw}Execute job}
The job is executed as follows. Specifications in sh system are as follows.
\vspace{3mm}\hrule

\hrule\vspace{3mm}

\verb+calc_chiqw+ is an executable file for dielectric function calculation. \verb+calc_chiqw+ is created by compiling in the directory \verb+RESPACK/src/chiqw+ (see the \ref{compile} section). The job is executed with input file \verb+input.in+ and files in the directory \verb+./dir-wfn+. \tr{This job is a hybrid parallel job [total MPI processes are 6 ({\tt -np 6})  and each MPI process consists of 16 threads]. If you omit {\tt MPI\_num\_proc\_per\_qcomm} and {\tt MPI\_num\_qcomm}, {\tt MPI\_num\_proc\_per\_qcomm=6} and {\tt MPI\_num\_qcomm=1} are automatically set. {\tt input.in} is read as standard input. Standard output of calculation  is output to {\tt LOG.chiqw} (standard output is in charge by MPI master by default).}

\subsection{\label{result-chiqw}Calculation results}
When the job is executed, a directory \verb+dir-eqs+ is created under the calculation directory. 
\tr{In this directory, frequency-grid information ({\tt dat.wgrid}), polarization-function-cutoff information ({\tt dat.chi\_cutoff}), electron-energy-loss spectrum ({\tt dat.eels-x, -y, -z}), optical-absorption spectrum ({\tt dat.optical\_conductivity-x, -y, - z}), reflectivity ({\tt dat.reflectivity-x, -y, -z}) are output. Here, {\tt -x, -y, -z} attached to the spectrum represents a Cartesian coordinates.}
 \tr{Furthermore, the directory {\tt qxxx} attached with the $q$ point number ({\tt xxx}) is generated under the {\tt dir-eqs} directory. Calculation results for each $q$ point are output in this directory. Note that the number of $q$ points (i.e., the number of the {\tt qxxx} directories) is the number of irreducible $q$ points (16 in the Al calculation). For the files in each {\tt qxxx} directory, for example, in the case of the 16th $q$ point, the following output files are generated in the {\tt q016} directory.}

\verb+dat.log.400+ is the calculation end flag. Inverse dielectric matrix \{$\epsilon_{{\bf GG'}}^{-1}({\bf q},\omega)$\} is accommodated in \verb+dat.epsqw.600+ in the binary format. \tr{For the files of 600000 series ({\tt dat.epsqw.600000}$\sim${\tt dat.epsqw.600070}), we store the diagonal term data of the inverse dielectric matrix for each frequency grid.} The first column is $|{\bf q+G}|$ (unit is Bohr$^{- 1}$), the second column is $\epsilon_{{\bf GG}}^{-1}{\bf q}, \omega_i)$, and the third column is the imaginary part.

\tr{The important point in performing the integral calculation is to calculate the inverse dielectric matrix of all irreducible $q$ points before this calculation.} This is because it is impossible to generate all the data on the Monkhorst-Pack mesh if the data at the irreducible $q$ point is insufficient.

In this demonstration, the calculation condition is loosened to shorten the calculation time. For convergence, it is necessary to make strict conditions. The Wannier function mainly depends on the density of the $k$ points and the wave function cutoff. The dielectric function depends on the number of unoccupied bands and the dielectric function cutoff. For the Al calculation, it is better to take 10$\times$10$\times$10-$k$ points, wave function cutoff 64 Ry, dielectric function cutoff 10 Ry, and unoccupied band number 50. In the case of constrained RPA, it is generally better to include the unoccupied bands up to several tens of eV above the Fermi level.

\section{\label{La2CuO4}La$_2$CuO$_4$ (Interaction evaluation using constrained RPA)} 

\tr{In this chapter, the evaluation of the interaction parameters of the transition-metal oxide La$_2$CuO$_4$ is described. In particular, we will describe the setting of the inner energy window in {\tt wannier} calculation and the constrained RPA option in {\tt chiqw} calculation. A condition for the band calculation (using {\sc xTAPP}) is a  6$\times$6$\times$6 $k$-point sampling (30 irreducible $k$ points), a wave function cutoff of 81 Ry, the total number of bands of 60 (26 occupied bands, 1 partial occupied band, 33 unoccupied bands, including the bands up to about 15 eV above the Fermi level).} 

\tr{In this calculation, since the constrained RPA calculation is performed, the variable {\tt flg\_cRPA} is set to {\tt 1}. To reduce the computational cost, the polarization function cutoff is set to 3 Ry (8.1 Ry by default). In case of the constrained RPA, we need to perform the {\tt wannier} calculation before the {\tt chiqw} calculation, because exclusion polarization is defined with the Wannier function. Therefore, the order of calculation is {\tt wannier}$\to${\tt chiqw}$\to${\tt calc\_w3d (calc\_j3d)}. Below is {\tt input.in} of La$_2$CuO$_4$ (body centered tetragonal lattice).

In the \verb+wannier+ calculation, we set the energy window to \verb+Lower_energy_ window=10.0 eV+ and \verb+Upper_energy_ window=15.6 eV+. \tr{Note that the values of the energy window depend on the band-calculation software.} We make the Wannier function with initial guess of $d_{x^2-y^2}$ centered at the position of the copper atom (\verb+dx2 0.2d0 0.0d0 0.0d0 0.0d0+). In this calculation, the inner window is set (\verb+set_inner_ window=T+). The inner window is set to \verb+Lower_inner_ window=12.6 eV+ and \verb+Upper_inner_window=13.4 eV+.

In this \verb+wannier+ calculation, we set the energy window to \verb+Lower_energy_window=7.0 eV+ and  \verb+Upper_energy_window=11.0 eV+ to include the $t_{2 g}$ bands. Also, in this calculation the variable \verb+flg_initial_guess_direc+ has been set to \verb+1+. As a result, the display coordinate of the initial Gaussian is changed to the local coordinate system. With this flag set, in addition to the basic information of the initial Gaussian, the local coordinate information defining the display coordinates are additionally input. Specifically, it is input as follows.

In the above, we place \verb+dxy+ Gaussian with width \verb+0.2 (au)+ at the position of \verb+(0.50, 0.50, 0.50)+ in the lattice coordinates. Also, this Gaussian is displayed along the local coordinates (${\bf L}_x, {\bf L}_y, {\bf L}_z$). Here, each local coordinate is as follows.
\begin{eqnarray} 
{\bf L}_x &=& -0.46 {\bf e}_x -0.46 {\bf e}_y + 0.76 {\bf e}_z, \nonumber \\
{\bf L}_y &=& +0.46 {\bf e}_x +0.46 {\bf e}_y + 0.76 {\bf e}_z, \nonumber \\
{\bf L}_z &=& -0.71 {\bf e}_x +0.71 {\bf e}_y + 0.00 {\bf e}_z, \nonumber 
\end{eqnarray} 
Here, ${\bf e}_x, {\bf e}_y, {\bf e}_z$ represent the Cartesian coordinates which are used in the band calculation. The local coordinates ${\bf L}_x, {\bf L}_y, {\bf L}_z$ are defined on the basis of the TiO$_6$ octahedron unit. ${\bf L}_x, {\bf L}_y, {\bf L}_z$ and ${\ bf e}_x, {\bf e}_y, {\bf e}_z$ are shown in Fig.~\ref{TiO2-local}. Regarding the components of the local coordinates, \tr{the user must calculate the values from the structure information by themselves.

\section{\label{pseudopotential}\tr{Pseudopotential dependence of interaction parameters}} 

\tr{As an example, consider the pseudopotential dependence of the interaction parameter of SrVO$_3$. The pseudopotential depends on the local potential cutoff parameter $r_c$. The pseudopotential constructed with small $r_c$ becomes deeper one, and the pseudo wavefunction obtained with this pseudopotential tends to distribute near the ion core. Figure~\ref{pwn-vs-aewn} compares the pseudo wavefunctions with different cutoff $r_c$ with the all-electron wavefunction (black thick line) for a vanadium atom. As the $r_c$ is reduced to 2.1 \AA (blue line) $\to$ 1.8 \AA (green line) $\to$ 1.5 \AA (red line), the maximum amplitude position of the pseudo wavefunction is shifted to the ion-core side. This tendency is noticeable in orbitals without nodes like the $1s$, $2p$, and $3d$ orbitals. The pseudopotentials with $r_c$ = 1.8 \AA and 2.1 \AA are ionized valence configurations ($3d^{3}4s^{0}4p^{0}$), and the pseudopotential with $r_c$ = 1.5 \AA was created for the ionized semicore configuration ($3s^{2}3p^{6}3d^{3}$). Also, the Troullier-Martins (TM) type was adopted as a function form of the pseudo wavefunction.}

\caption{\tr{Comparison of the radial part of the pseudo wavefunction and the all-electron wavefunction (black thick line) of the $3d$ orbital of a vanadium atom. The figure shows that, as the local potential cutoff parameter $r_c$ changes to 1.5 \AA (red line), 1.8 \AA (green line), 2.1 \AA (blue line), how the resulting pseudo wavefunction changes. The horizontal axis is the distance $r$ (\AA). By reducing the $r_c$ parameter, the maximum amplitude position of the pseudo wavefunction is shifted to the ion-core side ($r=0$).}} 
\label{pwn-vs-aewn}
\end{figure}

\tr{This tendency can also be seen in the Wannier function. The Wannier function with a pseudopotential with a small $r_c$ tends to be more localized. As a result, it gives a large direct integral. Table~\ref{rc-vs-interaction} is the $r_c$ dependence of interaction parameters for the $t_{2g}$ Wannier function of SrVO$_3$. The calculation conditions are a $6\times6\times6$ $k$-point sampling, a wavefunction cutoff of 144 Ry. Dielectric-function cutoff is 5 Ry, and the total number of bands is 100.}
We see from the table that $r_c$ and the Wannier spread $\Omega$ has positive correlation, where $\Omega$ is defined as 
\begin{eqnarray}
\Omega=\sqrt{ \langle r^2 \rangle - |\langle \mathbf{r} \rangle|^2 }. \nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}
\tr{It can also be seen that the $r_c$ and onsite direct integrals $U$, $U'$ have a negative correlation. There is no noticeable effect on the exchange integral $J$ and the nearest neighbor direct integral $V$. As pseudopotentials, besides the TM type, there are the RRKJ (Rappe-Rabe-Kaxiras-Joannopoulos) type and the ONCV (Optimized Norm-Conserving Vanderbilt) type. Even if the same cutoff $r_c$ is employed, the results can be quantitatively different due to the difference in the functional form of the pseudopotential, so be careful.}
